        <p>I once invited a minister long time ago to minister in our church, Overwhelming Love Ministries a.k.a Love Generals Assembly located at OBU-OFU UMUIKE VILLAGE AWKA. Incidentally, because of our location, UMUIKE VILLAGE, I consider us to be a village church, people call us village church and we are a village Church, though with a global mandate and impact. Any church located in the village reaching out basically to the villagers and then beyond, what will you call such a church, other than a village Church. Vise versa is a City Church.</p>
        <p>This minister, I invited came from one of the remote villages in Benue State, after his powerful teaching, we got talking, and he told me the kind of things they do to sustain their families and still keep the Lord's work going, since the offerings they get there can hardly run the services of the church, not to mention the welfare of the pastor, so they do farming, including animal husbandry, they sometimes cut firewood and sell, what baffled me was his enthusiasm and excitement, he joyfully narrated how those menial jobs, has helped them, and also helped the ministry. He told me also about their welfare packages to the widows and less privileged in the village.</p>
        <p>During their thanksgivings or pastors appreciation day, villagers bring cocoyam, tubers of yam, painter of Garry, bottles of oil, e.t.c. I watched him in amazement, so many things running through my mind. In his two days visit with us, we lodged him in a hotel and he was overly excited, it was written all over him, you could literally see the glow all over his face, maybe it was his first time of being lodged as a minister in that kind of hotel, I wouldn't know, but I could sense an aura of joy all around him, he was so appreciative of our hospitality. At the end of his visit, we gave him a love offering, drove him to the park where he boarded a bus back to his base.</p>
        <p>As a missionary, I have been to several mission fields, not in the US, Canada, Australia, Abuja, Lagos, or any of those cities and foreign land, but to remote villages, often without electricity and pipe born water, so I can perfectly relate with the story of my guest, but those will be for another day, back to my experience with my guest minister from Benue.</p>
        <p>As he left and I drove back to my house, sometimes later, As I pondered on my experience with this man of God, I realized that God has so many hidden Generals, not popularly known to their generation, they are not on any social media platform, not Tv station nor the internet. It also done on me that not all God's Generals live in a duplex or a three bedroom flat, not all drive the latest, nor build large auditorium with hundreds of thousands of worshippers, not all may be opportune to enjoy somethings in life, yet all are champions, and celebrated in the kingdom. Not all are known to men, but they are all known to God our father.</p>
        <p>The narrative for so many young ministers is that , if you don't have all these things, then you are not successful in ministry, but I stand to disagree as a missionary, because that day, I saw a kingdom General as I have always seen in most mission fields. I realized that their are Generals in this kingdom who may never be opportune to own a Mercedes or live in a Mansion in this life, but are yet prosperous.</p>
        <blockquote>"Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth." (<a href="http://b-bq.eu/3John/1_2/KJV" target="_blank" class="text-green-700 underline">3 John 1:2 KJV</a>)</blockquote>
        <p>The prosperity of the soul proceeds any other prosperity, and the prosperity in this scriptures is more than material prosperity, it is actually making progress in your kingdom Assignment, advancing in your life and destiny course, these Generals I met cannot boast of material prosperity, but they are sure making remarkable progress in their lives Assignment joyfully.</p>
        <p>To every shepherd reading this, who is actually making progress in their kingdom Assignment, whether known or unknown to men, I salute your courage, you are a champion, a kingdom General, a star in the hand of our Master in the middle of the seven golden candle sticks, continue to advance faithfully in your labour, for He is not unjust to forget your labour of love.</p>
        <blockquote>"For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which ye have showed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister." (<a href="http://b-bq.eu/Heb/6_10/KJV" target="_blank" class="text-green-700 underline">Hebrews 6:10 KJV</a>)</blockquote>
        <p>On that day, you will hear from our Lord.</p>
        <blockquote>"His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler, over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord." (<a href="http://b-bq.eu/Matt/25_21/KJV" target="_blank" class="text-green-700 underline">Matthew 25:21 KJV</a>)</blockquote>
        <p>To the General in the city who is known by all, I salute you and your landmark achievement, but please always remember to strengthen the arms of the unknown General in the remote areas, "maka na ofu Alhaji ka anyi na achili efi."</p>
