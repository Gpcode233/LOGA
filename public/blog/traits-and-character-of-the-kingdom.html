        <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. (<a href="http://b-bq.eu/Rom/14_17/KJV" target="_blank" class="text-green-700 underline">Romans 14:17 KJV</a>).</p>
        <p>The scriptures clearly stated that the kingdom is not characterized by meat or drinks, inorder wards having food to eat, cloths to wear, car to drive, house to live in, is not a proof of the manifestation of God's kingdom, Material possession only is not a proof of the manifestation of God's kingdom, they are additions to our lives, when we have found the kingdom according to the scriptures.</p>
        <p>The manifestation of the kingdom of God is therefore more than these things, yet some of these material things are the only thing many believers present as a proof and often testify in church of, as the manifestation of God's kingdom in their lives.</p>
        <p>We know that most unbelievers also have these things in abundance, yet do not belong to God's kingdom, it therefore means that the kingdom is more than these things.</p>
        <p>Let's outline the main attributes of God's kingdom according to the scriptures above.<br/>1). Righteousness<br/>2). Peace<br/>3). Joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>
        <h2>Righteousness</h2>
        <p>A right standing with God, cannot be obtained anywhere else, except in God's kingdom through the finished work of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
        <blockquote>"For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him." (<a href="http://b-bq.eu/2Cor/5_21/KJV" target="_blank" class="text-green-700 underline">2 Corinthians 5:21 KJV</a>)</blockquote>
        <p>This is the first trait and manifestation of God's kingdom in the life of an individual, a right standing with God. You can't buy that, you can't labour to have it, you can't earn it, it is the gift of God that ushers one into His kingdom. Every kingdom citizen has it, irrespective of his or her status, educational qualifications, race, colour or age. That is one thing no unbeliever has, as long as you are not yet part of His kingdom, and no kingdom or nation on earth can give it to you.</p>
        <h2>Peace</h2>
        <p>There is the peace obtainable in God's kingdom that can't be found anywhere else.</p>
        <blockquote>"And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus." (<a href="http://b-bq.eu/Phil/4_7/KJV" target="_blank" class="text-green-700 underline">Philippians 4:7 KJV</a>)</blockquote>
        <p>It is the peace that passes human understanding, the peace that stays even in the midst of Storm, no circumstances or situation can make you lose such peace, that's another attribute and manifestation of God's kingdom in a life, The peace of our Lord.</p>
        <blockquote>"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid." (<a href="http://b-bq.eu/John/14_27/KJV" target="_blank" class="text-green-700 underline">John 14:27 KJV</a>)</blockquote>
        <p>Being at peace with your Maker, you reverence and adore him, but yet completely at peace with Him.</p>
        <h2>Joy in the Holy Ghost</h2>
        <p>This is an unexplainable dimension of joy, an inner glow and radiance that has got nothing to do with the happenings around you. Only in God's kingdom is that obtainable by the Holy Ghost, that's the third manifestation of the kingdom: joy of salvation, joy of His indwelling presence, joy of relating with Him, joy in the face of trials and temptations. Only in the kingdom can that be obtained.</p>
        <p>These are the three main traits and attributes of God's kingdom; it is not subject to status, or any external influence, it is completely an inner witness and deposit showing you are now part of God's kingdom.</p>
        <blockquote>"Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you." (<a href="http://b-bq.eu/Luke/17_21/KJV" target="_blank" class="text-green-700 underline">Luke 17:21 KJV</a>).</blockquote>
